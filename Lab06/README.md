# Lab 6: Digital Signature 

## Objectives   
• Demonstrate the use of digital signatures    
• Demonstrate the verification of a digital signature   

## Lab Exercises

1. Implement and demonstrate the ElGamal and Schnorr digital signature schemes.
Show the process of key generation, message signing, and signature verification to ensure data integrity and authenticity.

2. Implement the Diffie–Hellman key exchange protocol, then use the derived shared key to create and verify digital signatures on exchanged messages.
Demonstrate how the shared secret can be used to authenticate communication.

3. Extend the above implementations into a client–server model using socket programming.
In this setup, the client sends a signed message to the server, the server verifies the signature, and both record and analyze observations on message integrity, authenticity, and possible attack scenarios.
