# Lab 6: Digital Signature 

## Objectives   
• Demonstrate the use of digital signatures    
• Demonstrate the verification of a digital signature   

## Lab Exercises

1. Try using the Elgammal, Schnor asymmetric encryption standard and 
verify the above steps.    
2. Try using the Diffie-Hellman asymmetric encryption standard and verify 
the above steps.   
3. Try the same in a client server-based scenario and record your 
observation and analysis.
