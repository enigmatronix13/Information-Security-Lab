have it encrypted using the master public key.

customers, allowing them to decrypt the content. 
• Access Control: Implement flexible access control mechanisms, such as: 
o Granting limited-time access to customers for specific content 
o Revoking access to customers for specific content 
o Allowing content creators to manage access to their own content 
• Key Revocation: Implement a process to revoke the master private key in case of a security 
breach or other emergency. 
40 
Database and Domain Name Servers (DNS) 
• Key Renewal: Automatically renew the master public-private key pair at regular intervals 
(e.g., every 24 months) to maintain the security of the DRM system. 
• Secure Storage: Securely store the master private key, ensuring that it is not accessible to 
unauthorized parties. 
• Auditing and Logging: Maintain detailed logs of all key management and access control 
operations to enable auditing and troubleshooting.
