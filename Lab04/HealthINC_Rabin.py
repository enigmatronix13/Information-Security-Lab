Suppose that XYZ Logistics has decided to use the RSA cryptosystem to secure their sensitive 
communications. However, the security team at XYZ Logistics has discovered that one of their 
employees, Eve, has obtained a partial copy of the RSA private key and is attempting to 
recover the full private key to decrypt the company's communications. 
Eve's attack involves exploiting a vulnerability in the RSA key generation process, where the 
prime factors (p and q) used to generate the modulus (n) are not sufficiently large or random. 
Develop a Python script that can demonstrate the attack on the vulnerable RSA cryptosystem  
and discuss the steps to mitigate the attack.
