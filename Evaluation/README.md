# Evaluation

Write a Python program to simulate secure clientâ€“server communication using:

- RSA to encrypt/decrypt the multiplicative cipher key,
- Multiplicative Cipher to encrypt/decrypt the message, and
- SHA-256 to verify message integrity.

The client should encrypt the message and key, generate a hash, and send them; the server should decrypt, verify, and display all steps and results.
