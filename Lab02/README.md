# Lab 2: Advanced Symmetric Key Ciphers

## Objectives 
• To understand the working of DES and AES algorithms.   
•  To implement AES and DES algorithm.   
• Analyze the performance of AES and DES algorithms.   

## Lab Exercises  
1. Encrypt the message "Confidential Data" using DES with the following key: "A1B2C3D4". 
Then decrypt the ciphertext to verify the original message.

2. Encrypt the message "Sensitive Information" using AES-128 with the following key: 
"0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF". Then decrypt the ciphertext to verify the 
original message.

3. Compare the encryption and decryption times for DES and AES-256 for the message 
"Performance Testing of Encryption Algorithms". Use a standard implementation and report 
your findings.
 
4. Encrypt the message "Classified Text" using Triple DES with the key 
"1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF". Then decrypt the 
ciphertext to verify the original message.

5. Encrypt the message "Top Secret Data" using AES-192 with the key 
"FEDCBA9876543210FEDCBA9876543210". Show all the steps involved in the encryption 
process (key expansion, initial round, main rounds, final round).   

## Additional Exercises: 

1.  Using DES and AES(128, 192, and 256 bits key).encrypt the five different messages using 
same key. 
a. Consider different modes of operation  
b.  Plot the graph which shows execution time taken by each technique. 
c. Compare time taken by different modes of operation

2. Encrypt the following block of data using DES with the key "A1B2C3D4E5F60708". The data 
to be encrypted is: Mathematica 
Block1: 54686973206973206120636f6e666964656e7469616c206d657373616765 
Block2: 416e64207468697320697320746865207365636f6e6420626c6f636b 
a. Provide the ciphertext for each block. 
b. Decrypt the ciphertext to retrieve the original plaintext blocks.

3. Using AES-256, encrypt the message "Encryption Strength" with the key 
"0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF". 
Then decrypt the ciphertext to verify the original message.

4. Encrypt the message "Secure Communication" using DES in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) 
mode with the key "A1B2C3D4" and an initialization vector (IV) of "12345678". Provide the 
ciphertext and then decrypt it to retrieve the original message.

5. Encrypt the message "Cryptography Lab Exercise" using AES in Counter (CTR) mode with 
the key "0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF" and a nonce of "0000000000000000". 
Provide the ciphertext and then decrypt it to retrieve the original message.
